# Practice vs Competition Menu Design Implementation

## Design Analysis & Fix

### **Original Issue:**
After login, users were redirected directly to the competition interface, bypassing any menu structure that would let them choose between Practice and Competition modes.

### **Intended Design (Now Implemented):**
The proper design separates **Practice Mode** and **Competition Mode** as distinct user flows:

#### **📚 Practice Mode**
- **Purpose**: Individual skill development
- **Features**: Solo learning, customizable sessions, progress tracking
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3001/practice`
- **Target Users**: Students and coaches wanting to improve individually

#### **🏆 Competition Mode**  
- **Purpose**: Real-time multiplayer competition
- **Features**: Live buzzer system, game rooms, real-time scoring
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3001/enhanced-competition`
- **Target Users**: Teams and players wanting competitive gameplay
