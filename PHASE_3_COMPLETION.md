### Socket.IO Events Implemented
```javascript
// Client → Server
authenticate(token)      // JWT authentication
create_room(data)       // Create new game room
join_room(data)         // Join existing room
buzz(data)              // Register buzzer press
submit_answer(data)     // Submit answer
start_game(data)        // Host starts game
leave_room(data)        // Leave current room

// Server → Client
authenticated(data)     // Authentication success
room_created(data)      // Room creation confirmation
room_updated(state)     // Game state updates
buzz_registered(data)   // Buzz acknowledgment
answer_result(data)     // Answer validation result
game_started(state)     // Game start notification
game_finished(data)     // Game completion
```

### Game Room State Management
```javascript
class GameRoom {
  - id: String (unique room identifier)
  - name: String (display name)
  - hostId: Number (room creator)
  - players: Map<userId, playerState>
  - currentQuestion: Object
  - gameState: 'WAITING' | 'ACTIVE' | 'BUZZING' | 'FINISHED'
  - buzzer: { isActive, buzzedPlayer, buzzTime }
  - scores: Map<userId, score>
  - settings: { questionCount, categories, difficulty }
}
```
