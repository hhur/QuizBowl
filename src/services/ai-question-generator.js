Format the question exactly as follows:
- Question: Write a clear, informative toss-up question (50-150 words) that builds in difficulty and provides multiple clues
- Answer: Provide the primary answer
- Acceptable answers: List alternative acceptable answers (if any)
- Category: ${category}
- Difficulty: ${difficulty}

Quiz Bowl question guidelines:
1. Start with harder clues and progress to easier ones
2. Provide multiple pathways to the answer
3. Include specific details and facts
4. End with the most recognizable clue
5. Avoid yes/no questions
6. Make it answerable by knowledgeable students

Example format:
Question: This author's novels often feature unreliable narrators and themes of moral ambiguity. Born in 1962, his works include "The Sense of an Ending" which won the 2011 Man Booker Prize. His earlier novels include "Flaubert's Parrot" and "A History of the World in 10¬Ω Chapters." For 10 points, name this British author known for his postmodern literary style.
