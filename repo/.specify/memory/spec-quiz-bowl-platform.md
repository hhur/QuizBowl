# Feature Specification: Quiz Bowl Practice & Competition Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-quiz-bowl-platform-core`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Quiz Bowl Practice & Competition Platform. A web-based platform designed to support high school quiz bowl teams in practicing, competing, and tracking performance. It leverages AI to generate curriculum-aligned questions and provides tools for virtual scrimmages and tournament management."

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A high school quiz bowl coach wants a single platform where the team can (a) run structured practice sessions using curriculum-aligned questions, (b) host or join virtual scrimmages with fair buzzing, (c) enroll in and manage online tournaments, and (d) track player and team performance over time. The platform also supports AI-assisted generation of new questions aligned with academic standards to fill gaps in certain categories.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a registered coach and rostered students, **When** the coach configures a practice session (categories, difficulty, number of questions) and starts it, **Then** players see questions delivered sequentially with timing and the system records responses and scores.
2. **Given** multiple teams in different locations, **When** they join the same virtual scrimmage lobby before the scheduled start time, **Then** they can buzz in real-time and the system deterministically adjudicates the first buzz and applies scoring rules.
3. **Given** a tournament organizer, **When** they create a new tournament with registration window and format (e.g., round robin → finals), **Then** teams can register until the deadline and brackets/pairings are generated once registration closes.
4. **Given** a coach requesting fresh questions in an underrepresented category, **When** they request AI-generated questions specifying subject, subtopic, difficulty, count, **Then** the platform returns draft questions flagged as “AI (Needs Review)” for manual approval before inclusion in official sets.
5. **Given** a player completes several practice sessions, **When** they view their performance dashboard, **Then** they see accuracy, category strengths, response speed distribution, and longitudinal improvement indicators.
6. **Given** a moderator overseeing a live match, **When** there is a challenge or suspected erroneous AI-generated question, **Then** they can flag it and it is removed from active rotation and queued for review.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all players disconnect mid-match? (Game should auto-pause after configurable grace period) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- AI generation request exceeds daily quota or cost threshold → return informative limit error and suggest existing question packs.
- Two users attempt to buzz within the same network latency window → deterministic ordering + latency metric logged.
- Player joins a game already in progress mid-question → should not see current question until next cycle. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Tournament registration below minimum viable team count at deadline → auto-cancel or extend registration? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- AI model returns low-quality or off-curriculum content → flagged and excluded by default until human approves.
- Duplicate question detection (AI vs existing bank) needed to avoid repetition. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: duplication threshold criteria]
